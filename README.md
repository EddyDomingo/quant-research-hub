üß† Strategies Included

The repo currently focuses on three core strategies:
	‚Ä¢	Momentum Trend
Identifies assets trading above their 50-day SMA and filters using RSI to avoid overbought signals.
	‚Ä¢	Mean Reversion (coming soon)
Will use indicators like Bollinger Bands and Z-score to capture price deviations.
	‚Ä¢	Statistical Arbitrage (coming soon)
Will involve pair trading, cointegration, and mean-reversion logic between correlated assets.

üìÅ Example: Momentum Trend Strategy

Below is a snapshot of the momentum trend strategy logic currently implemented:

1. Scrape tickers from the Nasdaq-100 list
2. Download 7 months of historical prices
3. Filter stocks trading above their 50-day SMA
4. Calculate RSI and exclude overbought assets (RSI > 70)
5. Sort remaining stocks by 6-month return
6. Print top 5 and allocate $10,000 to top 3 performers

 üîç Indicators used:
	‚Ä¢	50-Day Simple Moving Average
	‚Ä¢	RSI (Relative Strength Index)
	‚Ä¢	6-Month Return
